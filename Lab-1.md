# Deploy App in Dockerhub using Makefile

Dockerize a Basic Full Stack Application with React and Node.js using Makefile.
In this lab, we will guide you through the creation of a basic full-stack application where,

The frontend is built using React.
The backend is built using Node.js with Express.
Both the frontend and backend are dockerized using Docker.
The Images are built and pushed to DockerHub using a Makefile.

Overall Project directory:

Full-stack-app
|- backend
| |- index.js
| |- package.json
| |- Dockerfile
| .
|
|- frontend
| |- public
| |- src
| |- package.json
| |- Dockerfile
|  
|- Makefile
Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Setting Up the Backend (Node.js with Express)
Create a Directory for the Backend
mkdir Full-stack-app
cd Full-stack-app
mkdir backend
cd backend
Initialize the Node.js Project
npm init -y
alt text

This will create a package.json file.

Install Dependencies
Install express to handle server routing.

npm install express cors
alt text

Create index.js for the Backend
In the backend directory, create a file called index.js:

touch index.js
Edit index.js with the following content:

const express = require('express');
const os = require('os');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();
const PORT = 4000;

app.use(cors()); // Enable CORS for all routes

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
const message = "Hello world from the backend! ðŸš€";
console.log(message);
res.json({ message });
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
console.log(`Server Running at port ${PORT}`);
});
Create a Dockerfile for the Backend
In the backend directory, create a Dockerfile:

touch Dockerfile
Add the following contents to the Dockerfile:

# Use the official Node.js image from the Docker Hub

FROM node:14

# Create and set the working directory inside the container

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies

COPY package\*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the app files

COPY . .

# Expose the port that your app will run on

EXPOSE 4000

# Start the server

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
Step 2: Setting Up the Frontend (React)
Create a Directory for the Frontend
cd ..
npx create-react-app frontend
Modify the React App
Navigate to frontend/src/App.js and replace the content with the following code:

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function App() {
const [data, setData] = useState('Loading...');

const callAPI = async () => {
try {
const res = await fetch("http://localhost:4000/");
const data = await res.json();
setData(data.message);
} catch (error) {
console.log('Error:', error);
}
};

useEffect(() => {
callAPI();
}, []);

return (
<div className="App">
<h1>Backend Response:</h1>
<p>{data}</p>
</div>
);
}

export default App;
This fetches the message from the backend and displays it on the frontend.

Create a Dockerfile for the Frontend
In the frontend directory, create a Dockerfile:

touch Dockerfile
Add the following content:

# Stage 1: Build the React app

FROM node:16-alpine AS build

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json

COPY package\*.json ./

# Install dependencies

RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the code

COPY . .

# Build the React app for production

RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve the React app

FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the built app to the NGINX container

COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 to access the React app

EXPOSE 80

# Start NGINX

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
This Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build. The first stage builds the React app, and the second stage uses Nginx to serve the static files.

Step 3: Writing the Makefile
Let's create a Makefile to build and push the Docker images.

Create the Makefile
In the root directory, create a Makefile:

touch Makefile
Writing rite the Makefile step by step:
A Makefile is a simple text file that contains a set of rules used to automate the build and deployment process. It is often used with make, a build automation tool, to execute tasks like compiling programs, running tests, or building Docker images.

Here's a breakdown of how the Makefile works in our case:

Basic Structure of a Makefile:
A Makefile typically has the following components:

Variables: Used to store values like filenames, Docker image names, or versions to be reused.
Targets: These define tasks or commands that you want to run.
Recipes: The actual shell commands to be executed for a given target.
Phony Targets: Targets that aren't files, but commands that you want to run (e.g., build, clean).
Makefile:

# Variables

DOCKER_USERNAME = your-dockerhub-username
Variables: These are placeholders that store common values to avoid repetition. In this case, DOCKER_USERNAME holds the username for Docker Hub.

You should replace your-dockerhub-username with your actual Docker Hub username.

Frontend Section
FRONTEND_IMAGE_NAME = <your-frontend-image-name>
FRONTEND_TAG = latest
Frontend Variables: These store information specific to the frontend application, such as the Docker image name and tag.
build-frontend:
docker build -t $(FRONTEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(FRONTEND_TAG) ./frontend
build-frontend Target: This target runs the docker build command to build the Docker image for the frontend. The image name is set to $(FRONTEND_IMAGE_NAME) (i.e., react-frontend:latest).

./frontend is the directory containing the frontend source code and Dockerfile.

tag-frontend:
docker tag $(FRONTEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(FRONTEND_TAG) $(DOCKER_USERNAME)/$(FRONTEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(FRONTEND_TAG)
tag-frontend Target: This tags the newly built image using the docker tag command. The tag is composed of the DockerHub username ($(DOCKER_USERNAME)) and the image name and tag.

For example, it will tag the image as your-dockerhub-username/react-frontend:latest.

push-frontend:
docker push $(DOCKER_USERNAME)/$(FRONTEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(FRONTEND_TAG)
push-frontend Target: This command pushes the tagged image to DockerHub using the docker push command.
all-frontend: build-frontend tag-frontend push-frontend
all-frontend Target: This is a combined target that calls the build-frontend, tag-frontend, and push-frontend targets sequentially, effectively building, tagging, and pushing the Docker image in one command.

Backend Section
The backend section is nearly identical to the frontend section, but it operates on the backend Docker image. Here's a quick summary:

# Backend Variables

BACKEND_IMAGE_NAME = <your-backend-image-name>
BACKEND_TAG = latest
Specify the backend image name and tag.

# Build, tag, and push backend image

build-backend:
docker build -t $(BACKEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(BACKEND_TAG) ./backend

tag-backend:
docker tag $(BACKEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(BACKEND_TAG) $(DOCKER_USERNAME)/$(BACKEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(BACKEND_TAG)

push-backend:
docker push $(DOCKER_USERNAME)/$(BACKEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(BACKEND_TAG)

all-backend: build-backend tag-backend push-backend
Backend build, tag, push targets work the same way as the frontend targets but for the backend image.
alt text

# Run all for both frontend and backend in parallel

all: all-frontend all-backend
all Target: This target runs all-frontend and all-backend in parallel. It builds, tags, and pushes both frontend and backend images together when executed.
.PHONY Declaration
.PHONY: build-frontend tag-frontend push-frontend all-frontend clean-frontend \
 build-backend tag-backend push-backend all-backend clean-backend clean all
.PHONY: Declares that these targets are not files but commands. This ensures that make doesn't get confused by files with the same name as targets.
Why Use a Makefile?
Automation: You can define a sequence of steps and easily run them with simple commands like make all.
Consistency: Running the same commands in a structured way ensures that the same steps are followed every time, minimizing human error.
Parallelization: You can combine tasks and run them concurrently, like building both frontend and backend in parallel with make all.
Here is the Complete Makefile:

# Variables

DOCKER_USERNAME = your-dockerhub-username
FRONTEND_IMAGE_NAME = react-frontend
FRONTEND_TAG = latest
BACKEND_IMAGE_NAME = nodejs-backend
BACKEND_TAG = latest

build-frontend:
docker build -t $(FRONTEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(FRONTEND_TAG) ./frontend

tag-frontend:
docker tag $(FRONTEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(FRONTEND_TAG) $(DOCKER_USERNAME)/$(FRONTEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(FRONTEND_TAG)

push-frontend:
docker push $(DOCKER_USERNAME)/$(FRONTEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(FRONTEND_TAG)

all-frontend: build-frontend tag-frontend push-frontend

build-backend:
docker build -t $(BACKEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(BACKEND_TAG) ./backend

tag-backend:
docker tag $(BACKEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(BACKEND_TAG) $(DOCKER_USERNAME)/$(BACKEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(BACKEND_TAG)

push-backend:
docker push $(DOCKER_USERNAME)/$(BACKEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(BACKEND_TAG)

all-backend: build-backend tag-backend push-backend

clean-frontend:
docker rmi $(DOCKER_USERNAME)/$(FRONTEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(FRONTEND_TAG) || true
	docker rmi $(FRONTEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(FRONTEND_TAG) || true

clean-backend:
docker rmi $(DOCKER_USERNAME)/$(BACKEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(BACKEND_TAG) || true
	docker rmi $(BACKEND_IMAGE_NAME):$(BACKEND_TAG) || true

clean: clean-frontend clean-backend

all: all-frontend all-backend

.PHONY: build-frontend tag-frontend push-frontend all-frontend clean-frontend \
 build-backend tag-backend push-backend all-backend clean-backend clean all
Modify the DOCKER_USERNAME, Image_Name variable with your DockerHub username and image name for actual deployment.

How to Use:
First Login into Docker hub

docker login
Provide the credentials as needed.

alt text

To build, tag, and push the frontend image:

make all-frontend

To build, tag, and push the backend image:

make all-backend

To build, tag, and push both images in parallel:

make all
alt text

Check the created Docker images
After completion of the make command, you can check the newly created docker images:

docker images
alt text

Cleaning the images from local storage
We can run this command to clean the local images:

make clean
alt text

Step 4: Running the Application
Now that we have Docker images for both the frontend and backend, let's run the entire application using Docker.

Run the Backend server
Run the backend image:

docker run -p 4000:4000 your-dockerhub-username/<backend-image-name>
alt text

This will run the backend server on port 4000.

Run the Frontend Application
Run the frontend image:

docker run -p 80:80 your-dockerhub-username/<frontend-image-name>
This will run the frontend on port 80.

Conclusion
You've successfully created a full-stack application using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. Both applications were dockerized, and the images were built and pushed to DockerHub using a Makefile.

Summary of Concepts:
Docker: Used to containerize the application.
Makefile: Automates the build and push processes.
React: Frontend library.
Node.js/Express: Backend server for handling API requests.
Now you can further develop your app, enhance the features, and scale it using these building blocks!
